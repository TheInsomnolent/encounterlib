    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A tab-based SPA dashboard design was chosen to provide Dungeon Masters (DMs) with rapid, non-linear access to critical session components. The structure includes 'Overview', 'The Oblex', 'Encounters', 'DM Toolkit', and the new 'Player Briefing' tabs. This is superior to a linear document as a DM in a live game needs to jump between monster stats, room descriptions, and general rules fluidly. The 'Encounters' section uses an interactive card layout and a summary chart, allowing the DM to select a room and view its details instantly, which is the primary user flow during gameplay. This task-oriented design directly supports the DM's workflow. The 'Player Briefing' tab provides critical, secret information to compromised players in a discrete, easily accessible format. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Oblex Abilities -> Goal: Inform/Organize -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive 'stat block' with clickable ability details. -> Interaction: Click-to-expand details on Simulacrum/Eat Memories. -> Justification: Keeps the main view clean while providing deep info on demand. -> Library/Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: 7 Sewer Rooms (Table 2) -> Goal: Compare/Navigate -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive cards and a horizontal bar chart. -> Interaction: Clicking a card or chart bar displays that room's full details. The chart visualizes the escalating psychological tension of the encounters. -> Justification: Provides both a quick visual summary and a direct navigation path. -> Library/Method: Chart.js for the canvas-based chart.
        - Report Info: High-level play advice -> Goal: Inform -> Viz/Presentation: Collapsible accordion sections. -> Interaction: Click-to-expand. -> Justification: Hides dense text blocks until needed, reducing clutter. -> Library/Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: Player Simulacrum Rules -> Goal: Inform (secretly) -> Viz/Presentation: Dedicated tab with clear, concise text sections. -> Interaction: None (read-only briefing). -> Justification: Provides a private, structured briefing for players whose characters are replaced, ensuring they understand their new role and limitations without revealing it to others. -> Library/Method: HTML/CSS.

              Session Narrative Arc
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-slate-700">
              This session is a slow-burn psychological thriller designed to
              build paranoia. The adventure progresses through three distinct
              phases: Separation, Deception, and finally, Confrontation. The
              party will face challenges that subtly encourage them to split up,
              creating opportunities for the Elder Oblex to strike.

                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
                  Environmental puzzles and hazards force the party to make
                  tactical decisions that lead to natural, player-driven
                  separation.

                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
                  The Oblex uses its abilities to replace isolated PCs, creating
                  clones that sow discord and sabotage the party from within.

                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
                  The session culminates in a battle where players must fight
                  the Oblex and its simulacra, including clones of their own
                  allies.

              Emphasize the *why* of this mission. The party isn't just taking a
              shortcut; they are strategically avoiding powerful, omnipresent
              threats on the surface (e.g., guild checkpoints, magical
              surveillance). This high-stakes context justifies the dangerous
              subterranean journey and makes the sewer system a formidable
              challenge in itself, testing the party's wits and cohesion more
              than their raw power.

              The Elder Oblex is not a creature of brute force, but a master of
              psychological warfare. Its low CR (10) is deceptive; its true
              power lies in its formidable intelligence (INT 22) and its ability
              to turn the party against itself. Your goal is to foster an
              atmosphere of deep paranoia.

                    It's immune to damage but is severed if there is no opening

                    physical constraint. The Oblex must position its main body
                    strategically to keep its simulacra within range. Forcing a
                    heavy door closed or creating a rockfall between a clone and
                    the Oblex's hiding spot will destroy the clone. This makes
                    environmental control a key player strategy.

                  your character's class features (e.g., Action Surge, Sneak
                  Attack, Channel Divinity, Ki points, Bardic Inspiration, Wild

                  <strong>Magic Items:</strong> You can only use magic items
                  that *do not* require attunement. Attuned items cease to
                  function for you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Spells:</strong> You can cast spells of 5th level or
                  lower that your character knew, but these spells are now
                  powered by the Oblex's psionics.

                <li>
                  <strong>Shared HP:</strong> Your simulacrum shares the Oblex's
                  main hit point pool. Damage dealt to you reduces the Oblex's
                  total health. The DM will track this.
